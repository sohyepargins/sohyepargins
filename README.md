### Hi I'm SoHye 👋


- I love new learning journeys: I started studying linguistics, developed knowledge and skills in statistics and psychometrics, and have been expanding my expertise in data science (machine learning and natural language processing).
- 🔍 I also like exploring new areas of research with my analysis skill set: I worked on collecting, processing, and analyzing data from clinical research.
- 📕 I studied in the Quantitative Methodology: Measurement and Statistics (QMMS) program at UMD, earning a MS degree in 2022.  
- 📗 I've been studying applied linguistics/Second Language Acquisition (SLA) at UMD and am a PhD candidate.
- My goal is to gain experience and complete projects to jumpstart my career in data science and NLP. If you have any advice or opportunities, please reach out
