### Hi I'm SoHye 👋


- I love new learning journeys: I started studying linguistics, developed knowledge and skills in statistics, psychometrics, and data science (machine learning and natural language processing).
- 🔍 I also like exploring new areas of research/product development with my analysis skill set: I worked on collecting, processing, and analyzing data from clinical research, logistics, and ad technology.
- 📕 I studied in the Quantitative Methodology: Measurement and Statistics (QMMS) program at UMD, earning a MS degree in 2022.  
- 📗 I've been studying applied linguistics/Second Language Acquisition (SLA) at UMD and am a PhD candidate.
- I'm currently working as an Applied AI Scientist experimenting on the use of AI (particularly RAG) on my company's products.
